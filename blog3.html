        <p>One of the things we pride ourselves on at Ed2d is our ability to maintain client relationships. We've never lost a client and have had the pleasure of working with most of our clients on multiple events. It is truly humbling that our clients see value in our services and keep coming back. The best part about this is that that each time we work with client on an event, it allows us to deepen our understanding of their business, which inevitably results in better events every time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Late last year, we had the opportunity to once again work with TECTERRA. TECTERRA is a government funded organization that helps small and medium geomatics companies bring innovative solutions to market.  They do this through a variety of investment and grant programs that qualified companies can apply for. We have worked with TECTERRA in the past and we love them as a client because the are all about making an impact. This time, they came to us with the challenge of introducing the concept of geospatial standards to their Calgary partners.</p><br>
        <p>One of the things that sets Ed2d apart is that we set aside a serious amount of time to learn about the companies, products and industries that our clients work with. Needless to say, learning these industry specifics (such as what geospatial standards are) can be time consuming, but the return is well worth the effort.  It not only allows us to broaden our horizons and learn new things, but it also allows our team to have a greater understanding our clients and their business needs. </p><br>
        <p>Planning around these objectives, we were able to create a highly successful event that included the introduction of new concepts to the Calgary geomatics community.  Nothing gives our team more satisfaction than seeing an event connect people that may not have connected otherwise. This is why we love TECTERRA as a client. They always focus on creating these connections and building these communities in Calgary and the more we work with them, the more we are able to support their goals. </p>
