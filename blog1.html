        <div id="bname">Written By Kimmy</div>
        <img src="./images/benefit.png" alt="loading...">
        <p>Webinars and online training tools are replacing the idea of conferences and professional development events. That’s what they are saying, but we disagree! There is unique power in being connected to other people who are active in your line of work, through education and networking. I believe that professional development is best experienced in person and here's why.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Educational Opportunities</h1>
        <p>This may be an obvious reason, but it is also one of the top reasons… Most conferences offer exclusive keynote speakers, breakout sessions, and hands-on training to help you improve or learn new skills. No matter how experienced you are at your role, everyone can learn. Learning new ways to use a program, manage an issue or identify solutions can improve the way you conduct your work and help you unlock increased productivity within your organization.</p><br>
        <h1>Networking with Peers</h1>
        <p>Let’s face it. Attending an in-person networking event will bring out the social butterfly in you. Collaboration is the way to approach networking opportunities. Speaking with others who are like-minded and can relate to your organization can open conversation for innovation. Meeting others who have a different perspective can help unlock ideas and Ed2d creativity. </p><br>
        <h1>Position Yourself As an Expert</h1>
        <p>When you are active in your industry, you begin to develop a positive reputation as an expert to your peers and clients. This will improve your personal brand and your clients will feel good about doing business with those who are well-known in the industry. Before you know it, you will no longer need to position yourself as an expert because you will become one! </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Access to Latest Technology and Suppliers</h1>
        <p>Be the first to know about popular industry products, trends and services for your organization. In a fast-paced world, it’s important to stay competitive and understand your full potential. Learn about latest ways to engage your clients, empower your employees or coworkers, and optimize operations. You can meet with event sponsors, product experts, and suppliers to learn about (and maybe even demo!) the latest technology in the industry.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Get that out of Office Perspective</h1>
        <p>Still on the fence about attending? Working for your organization should have it’s perks too! A change of pace and environment has been known to improve employee productivity and creativity. And if the timing is right, you can extend your stay to include a little R&R!</p>
